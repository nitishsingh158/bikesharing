### Overview
This project showcases Tableau Visualizations of the NYC Citi Bike program. This study is targeted at investors interested in investing in a similar business model focused on Des Moines, Iowa. To conduct the analysis we use the NYC Citi Bike dataset. The data set contains trip details for August 2019 which is the busiest period of the year. The final visualization is provided as a link in the Results section.

### Result 
The charts in the tableau presentation Des Moins Bike Share show the following
1. More than 80% of the bike users are subscribers.
2. Subscribers tend to use the service more during the weekdays and the one time users utilize the service mainly on weekends. 
3. Males are the most frequent users.
4. Most of the bike pick up locations are in downtown NYC and near Subway stations or tourist attractions. 
5. The busiest days of the week are Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.
